This is what I think it would be good if you look into next:

 - Replacing the ugly green background in "game launcher" with a real background
 - Replacing the "black box" on that green background that says "pig" with another clickable object that looks like something that might be used in game

Now in order to fix those things, there are some basic things you need to learn in regards to flash.

----------------------------------
	General stuff
----------------------------------
- Don't worry about destroying things, everything is saved and backed up
- If you need to return to the original version of a file, right click on it and press 'revert' (this is what versioning systems are all about)
- I strongly suggest you start with changing your flash-layout to "Designer" (Window/workspace/Designer)
- When you want to test what the application looks like right now just press "ctrl + enter" inside Flash to compile everything and then launch the application.

----------------------------------
	Green background
----------------------------------
Inside the fla-folder you will find Borbela.fla
In that fla-file you will find a movieclip "GameContainer" in Library

- You need to get your picture into this fla-file and place it on stage where the green thing used to be
- Flash knows from where you import a file, so probably wise to have the iamge file in correct place from the beginning

----------------------------------
	Black boxes
----------------------------------
Borbela.fla/GameContainer

- replace the black boxes and the text with something appropriate
- whatever you place there needs to be inside a movieclip named "pig" (as it is now) in order to not break navigation (from code I'm listening to clicks on that movieclip to launch the actual pig-game).

-----------------------------------

Best of luck and just click around in flash and try to understand how it works and see what happens when you change stuff! :)

And, dont worry about breaking stuff^^
